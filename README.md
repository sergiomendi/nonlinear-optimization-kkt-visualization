# Constrained Optimization with KKT in Python

Small project that solves a nonlinear constrained optimization 
problem using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and visualizes the 
feasible set, level curves, and KKT points in Python.

## Project overview

- Define objective and constraint functions.
- Compute KKT candidate points for different active-set cases.
- Check feasibility and classify points.
- Plot feasible region, constraint boundaries and level curves.
- Highlight KKT points and global optimum.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Files

- `trabajo_academico.py`: main script with KKT computation and plots.

## How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/sergiomendi/constrained-optimization-kkt-python.git
cd constrained-optimization-kkt-python
python script.py
```
